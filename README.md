# Git Cleaner

This script helps you clean the history of a Git repository by deleting a specified file from the repository's history using the BFG Repo-Cleaner.

## Prerequisites

- Java must be installed on your system.
- `tput` must be installed on your system.
- The BFG Repo-Cleaner (`bfg`) must be present in the local directory.

## Usage

**Ensure prerequisites are met:**
    - Java is installed.
    - `tput` is installed.
    - The BFG Repo-Cleaner (`bfg`) is in the local directory.

To run the `git-cleaner.sh` script, you need to ensure that all prerequisites are met and then execute the script with the necessary inputs. Here is an example of a full working command sequence:

  1. Open your terminal.
  2. Navigate to the directory containing the `git-cleaner.sh` script.
  3. Run the script:

```bash
./git-cleaner.sh
```

4. Follow the prompts:

```plaintext
######################################################
#              Git Repo History Cleaner              #
######################################################

Enter path to repo to clean (absolute): /path/to/your/repo
Enter the filename to delete (from repo's root): sensitive_file.txt
The following file will be deleted: sensitive_file.txt

Do you want to continue? (y/n): y
Deleting...
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the absolute path to your Git repository and `sensitive_file.txt` with the filename you want to delete from the repository's history.
## Notes

- Ensure the repository path is correct and the repository exists.
- Ensure the filename is correct and not empty.
- The script will prompt for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.
